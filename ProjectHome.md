Apple TV3 is only capable to play mp4 files. For those who has an NAS and stores MKV files on it, appletv-mserver provide a simple way to play these MKV files.

This project is a replacement for my previous working on porting AirVideo Server to My Book Live.

LibAV code is get from inmethod.com(AirVideo Server). Thanks them for the segmenter code patch.
